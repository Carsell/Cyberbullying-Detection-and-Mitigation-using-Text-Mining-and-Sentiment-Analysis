Data Preprocessing:
Clean and transform text data
Apply lemmatization for improved text representation

Text Mining:
Utilize CountVectorizer and TF-IDF for feature extraction
Visualize top word frequencies using bar charts

Sentiment Analysis:
Train a Random Forest classifier for sentiment classification
Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Word Clouds:
Visualize word frequencies in cyberbullying and non-cyberbullying contexts

Topic Modeling:
Apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic extraction from text data
Explore the Jupyter Notebook (cyberbullying_detection.ipynb) for a detailed walkthrough. Contribute to creating a safer online environment by effectively identifying and preventing instances of cyberbullying.
